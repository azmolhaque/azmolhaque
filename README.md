# 👋 Hi, I'm Md. Azmol Haque Rony

<h3 align="center">Cyber Security Analyst | Healthcare & Humanitarian Aid Veteran</h3>

---

### 🛡️ About My Mission

I am a highly driven **Cyber Security Analyst** committed to building resilient and secure digital environments. My technical expertise spans **vulnerability assessment, penetration testing,** and **threat detection** using tools like Kali Linux, Nmap, and SIEM platforms.

What sets me apart is my unique foundation: **I bridge the worlds of healthcare and security.** My experience as a Humanitarian Nurse with **Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)** ingrained in me a disciplined, crisis-management mindset and a profound appreciation for data integrity. I approach security not just technically, but with a deep, empathetic understanding of human-centric risks and operational continuity.

> 🔑 **My Differentiator:** I translate critical thinking from the emergency room to the threat landscape, creating security solutions that are both technically robust and strategically aligned with real-world objectives.
