🔑 Executive Summary: The Crisis Edge

I am a highly disciplined Security Practitioner with 3+ years of equivalent Security Operations experience in threat hunting and vulnerability management.

My defining strength is the integration of proven technical hunting skills (OWASP Top 10, API Misconfiguration) with a decade of high-stakes Crisis Management (Médecins Sans Frontières / MSF). This background guarantees the precision, integrity, and calm execution crucial for Incident Response Runbooks and digital forensics under pressure.

🎯 Quantified Technical Impact: Threat Hunting Trophies

This section demonstrates hands-on, verifiable expertise in identifying, triaging, and documenting critical security flaws—core functions aligned with SOC Tier 2 Analysis and Vulnerability Triage.
